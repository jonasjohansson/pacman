      Welcome to the Jagad game, play alone or up to 4 players. Your goal is to catch the Jagad fugitives as fast as possible. Click 'Play' to join. If a game is already playing, you can join, or wait until it's over to start a new game. Each game is 90 seconds. Use the joystick to control your chaser: move left, right, up, and down.
